\section{Continuous Integration (CI)}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{What is Continuous Integration?}
  \begin{itemize}
    \setlength{\itemsep}{1em}
    \item A practice where tests and builds are run automatically after code changes were
      merged
    \item Goal: Find bugs, improve software quality (\eg, performance) and ensure
      your software runs on different platforms
    \item Every commit triggers a CI job
    \item Addressing failed CI jobs before merging a PR ensures code quality
    \item Runnind tests locally before committing adds an extra layer of verification
  \end{itemize}
