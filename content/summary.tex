\begin{frame}[fragile]{Summary | CI}
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item CIs are great tools to test and lint your code on the remote server
    \item They should be used in tandem with tests on your \textbf{local} machine (see also \texttt{pre-commit})
    \item Depending on your requirements, some work is necessary to setup everything (\eg, job runners)
  \end{enumerate}
